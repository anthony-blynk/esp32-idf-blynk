# IDF Blink with Blynk Example

This is the ESP IDF Blink example with the Blynk.Edgent library added to it so that it supports Wifi provisioning and OTA updates from Blynk.

Main changes are:

- checking out the ESP32 Arduino framework into the components folder:
```
cd components
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32.git arduino
cd arduino
git checkout tags/v3.2.0  # Replace with your target version
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- checkout aout the Blynk library into the components folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library.git blynk
```

- there are two compile errors in the Blynk library when running with IDF, with easy fixes:
```
```

- and some updates to CMakeLists.h and idf.component.yml

- creating a blynk folder in the main folder and copying in the Blynk .h files from https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/tree/master/examples/Blynk.Edgent/Edgent_ESP32

- also in the blynk folder adding three new files: blynk_interface.cpp, blynk_interface.h, and blynk_main.cpp

- updating the existing blink_example_main.c to call blynkblynk_init()

# Blink Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example demonstrates how to blink a LED by using the GPIO driver or using the [led_strip](https://components.espressif.com/component/espressif/led_strip) library if the LED is addressable e.g. [WS2812](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf). The `led_strip` library is installed via [component manager](main/idf_component.yml).

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with normal LED or addressable LED on-board (e.g., ESP32-S3-DevKitC, ESP32-C6-DevKitC etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`).

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Select the LED type in the `Blink LED type` option.
  * Use `GPIO` for regular LED
  * Use `LED strip` for addressable LED
* If the LED type is `LED strip`, select the backend peripheral
  * `RMT` is only available for ESP targets with RMT peripheral supported
  * `SPI` is available for all ESP targets
* Set the GPIO number used for the signal in the `Blink GPIO number` option.
* Set the blinking period in the `Blink period in ms` option.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

As you run the example, you will see the LED blinking, according to the previously defined period. For the addressable LED, you can also change the LED color by setting the `led_strip_set_pixel(led_strip, 0, 16, 16, 16);` (LED Strip, Pixel Number, Red, Green, Blue) with values from 0 to 255 in the [source file](main/blink_example_main.c).

```text
I (315) example: Example configured to blink addressable LED!
I (325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (1325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (2325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (3325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (4325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (5325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (6325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (7325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (8325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
```

Note: The color order could be different according to the LED model.

The pixel number indicates the pixel position in the LED strip. For a single LED, use 0.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.
